# SAR-Ship-Dataset
This dataset labeled by SAR experts was created using 102 Chinese Gaofen-3 images and 108 Sentinel-1 images. It consists of 43,819 ship chips of 256 pixels in both range and azimuth. These ships mainly have distinct scales and backgrounds. It can be used to develop object detectors for multi-scale and small object detection. The details of this dataset is referred to "Wang, Yuanyuan, Chao Wang, Hong Zhang, Yingbo Dong, and Sisi Wei. 2019. "A SAR Dataset of Ship Detection for Deep Learning under Complex Backgrounds."  Remote Sensing 11 (7). doi: 10.3390/rs11070765." 

Currently, we have released all the dataset for ship detection using SAR images, which has 43,819 ship chips.
